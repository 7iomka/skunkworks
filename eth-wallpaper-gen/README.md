## ETH Wallpaper Generator

Generate wallpapers from any image! Simply run the script with two arguments:

```bash
$ python main.py input.jpg output.jpg [ETH_SCALE]
```

to generate an `output.jpg` that is based on the input, but with the ETH wallpaper embedded!

`ETH_SCALE` is a decimal that defines the size of the Ethereum logo. A value of `1` will
embed a logo of size similar to the foundation's official wallpapers. Anything larger
will produce larger logos.
